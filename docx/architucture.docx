Architecture and Flow of the User Feedback System
1. Architecture Overview
The User Feedback System follows a Client-Server architecture, consisting of two main components:

Frontend (React): The user-facing application that allows users to submit feedback and view it in a dashboard.

Backend (Node.js with Express): The server-side application responsible for handling requests, processing feedback data, and interacting with the database.

Database: Stores the feedback data, including user name, email, feedback text, and timestamp.

2. Backend Architecture
Node.js and Express Server
The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js to handle incoming HTTP requests.

API Endpoints:

POST /feedback: Accepts user feedback submitted through the frontend form.

GET /feedback: Retrieves all feedback for display on the dashboard.

Database
The backend interacts with MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store feedback data.

MongoDB: Uses collections to store feedback documents.

PostgreSQL: Uses tables to store feedback rows.

Security Considerations
Input validation is performed to prevent SQL/NoSQL injection and to ensure feedback data is sanitized before being stored.

3. Frontend Architecture
React UI
The frontend is built using React for a responsive, dynamic user experience.

Components:

FeedbackForm: A form for users to submit feedback (includes fields like name, email, and feedback text).

Dashboard: Displays the collected feedback in a list and includes options to filter and sort the data.

State Management
State is managed locally in components using React hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect) to handle feedback data and control UI updates.

API Communication
The frontend communicates with the backend via HTTP requests using fetch:

POST /feedback: To submit feedback.

GET /feedback: To retrieve feedback for display on the dashboard.

4. Flow of the Application
Feedback Submission
The user fills out the FeedbackForm with their name, email, and feedback text.

Upon submitting the form, a POST request is sent to the backend (/feedback endpoint).

The backend processes the feedback and stores it in the database.

Dashboard Display
The frontend makes a GET request to the backend (/feedback endpoint) to fetch all feedback.

The feedback is displayed on the Dashboard in a list format.

Users can filter and sort feedback based on criteria like submission date or category (optional).
